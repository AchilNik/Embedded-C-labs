ATmega4808 C Projects â€“ Microcontroller Simulations
Overview

This repository contains small projects written in C for the ATmega4808 microcontroller, designed to simulate the operation of various electronic devices.
Each project demonstrates fundamental concepts of embedded systems programming, such as input handling, output control, LED indicators, and simple device logic.

Features

Written in C using AVR Libc.

Uses GPIO pins for inputs (buttons) and outputs (LEDs).

Demonstrates interrupt handling, state management, and basic device logic.
