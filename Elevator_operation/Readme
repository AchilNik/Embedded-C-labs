The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to simulate the operation of an elevator that can move between three levels. The elevator has two buttons for movement in the two directions: up and down. Movement occurs between the ground floor, 1st floor, and 2nd floor when the corresponding button (up or down push button) is pressed, and a different combination of LEDs is activated to indicate the elevatorâ€™s current position.
