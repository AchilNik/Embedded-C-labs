Overview

This laboratory exercise simulates the operation of a fan using the ATmega4808 microcontroller.
The fan consists of two rotational motions:

Rotation of the blades.

Rotation of the base, allowing the fan to cover a larger area.

Both motions are simulated with Pulse-Width Modulators (PWMs) and are represented using LED indicators.

Functionality

Blade Rotation: Simulated with a PWM signal of period Tl = 1 ms and duty cycle Dl = 60%. LED0 (PORTD PIN0) lights up during the rising edge of the pulse.

Base Rotation: Simulated with a PWM signal of period Tb = 2 ms and duty cycle Db = 40%. LED1 (PORTD PIN1) lights up during the rising edge of the pulse.

Fan Activation: The fan starts when switch 6 on PORTF is pressed:

First press: Blade and base rotation start with the initial PWM periods and duty cycles.

Second press: Blade PWM period is halved and duty cycle set to 50%, base rotation continues unchanged.

Third press: Fan stops, both PWMs stop their operation.

Interrupt Handling: Each PWM has its own ISR. Care is taken to ensure that rising edges of the two PWMs do not occur simultaneously to avoid missing LED pulses.
