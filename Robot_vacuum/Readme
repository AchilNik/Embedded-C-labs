Overview

This laboratory exercise simulates the operation of a smart home device that moves autonomously within an empty room.
The device starts from a corner of the room and its goal is to map the room's perimeter.

Functionality

Obstacle Detection: The device is equipped with sensors to measure distances from obstacles.

Sensor values are read via the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

If a sensor detects an obstacle below a predefined threshold (any value between 1â€“254), the device stops and turns left.

If the right sensor indicates no obstacle (value above the threshold), the device moves right.

Room Completion: When the device returns to the starting corner, it stops.

Return Command: If a switch is pressed, the device performs a 180-degree turn and retraces its path back to the starting position.
