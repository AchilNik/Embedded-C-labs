Overview

This project simulates the operation of a highway and railway crossing, implemented on the ATmega4808 microcontroller using C.
The system models the interaction between a major road and a perpendicular railway track, including traffic and pedestrian signals.

Functionality

Main Road Traffic Lights: Controls car traffic on the major road.

Pedestrian Traffic Lights: Lights up only after pressing a push button.

Tram Passage: A tram passes along the railway at regular intervals T1, interrupting normal traffic. During tram passage, the following occurs for a duration T2:

Red light for cars on the main road.

Green light for pedestrians.

Pedestrian Button: When pressed, the pedestrian green light activates along with the car red light for the main road for a duration T2.

Safety Interval: After the pedestrian signal has been activated, a waiting period T3 must elapse before the button can trigger the green light again.

Non-interruptible Timing: If the pedestrian button is pressed while a cycle is already active (due to either a previous press or a tram passage), the ongoing sequence continues uninterrupted until completion.
